This repository contains everything you need to make your own real-life, hard copies of every volume of _[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)_, with ~~Lulu~~ [Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/)! 

> **Warning:** Lulu has cancelled people's orders that use this method. Others recently used the resources in this guide to order the books from Blurb, another online publishing website. Do not attempt to sell this book on blurb. Not only is it illegal, but when blurb innevitably receives a copyright claim, they will no longer print these books for anyone else.

Eliezer Yudkowsky, or anyone else, isn't allowed to sell the book, because it's based on J. K. Rowling's copyrighted universe of characters. But, you _can_ create your own private copy of the book with ~~Lulu~~ Blurb, a service that prints books on demand, and then order yourself a proof copy. That way, you can experience it on paper!

Want an ebook? Then you don't need this repository! Because that's [already officially supported](http://hpmor.com/).

This morning she'd made herself toast, and put butter on the toast, and cinnamon on the butter, and it really should've been enough to get her to _notice_...

Behind them the doors of Hogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds moved closer. The track they now walked was muddy and indistinct. The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not fully clad with spring; their...

## Instructions

To get your own hard copies of each of the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality volumes, I'll walk you through how to print them with ~~Lulu~~ Blurb. We're going to use Blurbs's "private" feature, so that the books are only visible to you, so that you aren't violating any copyright laws by "profiting" off of the works. (Don't worry, it's easy!)

If you haven't made a book on Blurb before, follow the [step by step instructions](Instructions.md).

If you have, here's the TL;DR:

- Create an account on Blurb.
- Create a new **Trade 6" x 9" paperback** book on Blurb.
- Make sure to select "Create and Upload your PDF"
- Upload Cover and Pages as seperate files.
- Select soft cover and Economy B&W paper.
- Use Blurb's free IBN number.
- **Make the book only available to yourself**.
- Repeat for each volume.

## Praise

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality poses an alternate world in which Harry is a genius. ... It's a terrific series, subtle and dramatic and stimulating. Yudkowsky gets it, and lots else. Smart guy, good writer. Poses hugely terrific questions that I, too, had thought of... and a number that I hadn't. Enjoyed all references to the Enlightenment. I wish all Potter fans would go here, and try on a bigger, bolder and more challenging tale."
> —[David Brin](http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2010/06/secret-of-college-life-plus.html)

> "Oh Thoth Trismegistus, oh Ma'at, oh Ganesha, oh sweet lady Eris... I have not laughed so hard in years! ... Read it and laugh. Read it and learn. Eliezer re-invents Harry Potter as a skeptic genius who sets himself the task of figuring out just how all this "magic" stuff works. Strongly recommended. And if you manage to learn about sources of cognitive bias like the Planning Fallacy and the Bystander Effect, among others, while your sides are hurting with laughter, so much the better."
> —[Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2100)

> "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is the sort of thing that would technically be called a fanfic, but is more appropriately named a work of sheer genius. It takes the basic Harry Potter story and asks, "what if, instead of a boy locked in a closet, he was a child genius raised by a loving pair of adoptive parents who brought science, reason, and modern thinking to the wizarding world?" ... LOVE. IT. Read it, seriously. It will change your way of looking at the world."
> —[Rachel Aaron](http://civilian-reader.blogspot.com/2011/05/interview-with-rachel-aaron.html)

> "This is a book whose title still makes me laugh and yet it may just turn out to be one of the greatest books ever written. The writing is shockingly good, the plotting is some of the best in all of literature, and the stories are simply pure genius. I fear this book may never get the accoldaes it deserves, because it's too hard to look past the silly name and publishing model, but I hope you, dear reader, are wiser than that! A must-read."
